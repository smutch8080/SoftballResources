**Skill Level:** Intermediate  
**Time Required:** 10 minutes  
**Players Needed:** 1 hitter, 1 tosser  
**Equipment:** Bucket of balls, bat, net or fence

### Coaching Tips

- Inside tosses: Hitter should get hands through quickly, contact point more in front

**Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced  
**Time Required:** 10 minutes  
**Players Needed:** 1 hitter, 1 tosser  
**Equipment:** Bucket of balls, bat, net or fence

### Instructions

1. Tosser kneels at 45-degree angle to hitter, about 3-5 feet away
2. Before each toss, tosser calls out desired elevation: "ground ball," "line drive," or "fly ball"
3. Hitter adjusts swing path to produce the called elevation
4. Complete 15-20 tosses, mixing up the called elevations

### Coaching Tips

- Ground ball: Slightly downward swing path, top hand dominant
- Line drive: Level swing path, balanced hand action
- Fly ball: Slight uppercut, bottom hand more active
- Focus on subtle adjustments rather than dramatic swing changes
- Great drill for teaching situational hitting
