## Target Practice {#target-practice}

**Skill Level:** Beginner to Advanced  
**Time Required:** 15-20 minutes  
**Players Needed:** Pitcher, catcher

2. Divide strike zone into 9 sections (3x3 grid)
3. Coach calls out section numbers randomly
4. Pitcher aims for the called section
5. Track success rate for each section
6. Complete 3-5 pitches to each section

## Pitching Ladder {#ladder}

**Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced  
**Time Required:** 15 minutes  
**Players Needed:** Pitcher, catcher  
**Equipment:** Softballs, strike zone target or catcher's mitt

### Instructions

1. Pitcher starts by throwing to the lowest part of the strike zone
2. After successful pitch, move target slightly higher
3. Continue moving up until reaching the top of the strike zone
4. Then work back down to the bottom
5. If pitcher misses a spot, stay at that level until successful
6. Complete full ladder (up and down) 2-3 times

### Coaching Tips

- Emphasizes pitch height control
- Watch for consistent mechanics despite changing target height
- Focus on subtle adjustments rather than changing entire mechanics
- Great for developing feel for the entire strike zone
- Can be adapted for inside/outside control by moving horizontally

## Three-Strike Challenge {#three-strike}

**Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced

## Pitching Around the Clock {#around-clock}

**Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
